# Chaos Game
Creates fractals by iteratively creating a sequence of points, starting with the initial random point, in which each point in the sequence is a given fraction of the distance between the previous point and a random one of a polygon's vertices.

#### Sierpinski Triangle Fractal
![sierpinski_triangle](https://github.com/benjaminrall/chaos-game/blob/master/sierpinski_triangle.png?raw=true)
One of the most well known and standard fractals from the Chaos Game method, generated with n=3, r=0.5.

#### Rainbow Hex Fractal
![rainbow_hex](https://github.com/benjaminrall/chaos-game/blob/master/rainbow_hex.png?raw=true)
Generated with n=6, r=0.5.

#### Spirals Fractal
![spirals](https://github.com/benjaminrall/chaos-game/blob/master/spirals.png?raw=true)
Generated with n=5, r=0.5, where the same point cannot be chosen twice in a row.

#### Star Fractal
![star](https://github.com/benjaminrall/chaos-game/blob/master/star.png?raw=true)
Generated with n=5, r=0.5, where if the same point is chosen twice in a row the next point cannot be a direct neighbour.
